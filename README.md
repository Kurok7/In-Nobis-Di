# In-Nobis-Di

This is a starter website for In Nobis Di, a graphic novel collaboration between me and James Eximiris under Apocrypha LLC. I intend to use this as a starting point for my web development career. The information in this will be updated as I complete the story. The actual novel will be published on various web comic platforms and on the website once finished.
