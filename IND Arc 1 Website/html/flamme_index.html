    <h4 id="yourself">About</h4>
    <p>A young woman from an obscure village in South Korea. She is an outgoing woman who tossed aside
        her true name when she left Korea at the tender age of 7. When she was 5, she lost both her 
        parents to murder and her guardian at the time took her to Seoul and abandoned her there.
        Her rough childhood led her to be an independent woman who looks after her own self 
        interests first. Once she left, she befrended Aeni and started learning how to care for 
        others. She helped Aeni escape the orphanage and they made it to America only to become
        separated. She once again had to fend for herself until a dance instructor found her and
        took her into his home. Now, she's found her passion in dancing and hopes for Alex to take
        her to new heights in the industry. However, she has a second goal in mind. One that puts her
        at odds with an old friend.

    <h4 id="family">Heraldry</h4>
    <p>Jenine is the Herald of Amaterasu, an odd figure within the gods. She is a Class 4 Herald,
        a title that bestows upon her extreme Heraldic potential. Perhaps due to her upbringing or
        the stubborn nature of Amaterasu, Jenine is able to endure much more than normal Heralds,
        allowing her to push beyond her limits with little consequence. She is also able to grasp
        the nature of her powers at a faster rate than most Heralds of her Class and below. Her
        capabilities are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Divine use of Fire <em>(Pyrokinesis)</em></li>
        <li>Regeneration</li>
        <li>Mitigation</li>
        <li>Flight</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Though her capabilities are limited, she will gain more abilites at her disposal as she grows more proficient with her power.
