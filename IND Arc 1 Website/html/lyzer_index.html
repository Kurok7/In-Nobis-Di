    <h4 id="yourself">About</h4>
    <p>This young woman is an aspiring MMA contender from Los Angeles. She fights because she found out at a young age
        that her talent was fighting due to her never losing a match to her peers. She honed her skills
        from her master Kuro and developed her own style over the years to become an unstoppable force in the ring. 
        She hopes to amass enough money to open her own studio and train women on defending themselves. 
        Her goal is directly tied to the troubled past of her dear sister Aeni Silverlake. Eliza's past
        wasn't also peaches and cream as she had to deal with a father who abandoned her and Aeni after
        her mother died. She soon moved to Vegas to leave her past behind and start anew.</p>
