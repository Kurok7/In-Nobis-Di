    <h4 id="yourself">About</h4>
    <p>This young woman is the oldest one of the trio and from the UK. She is a quiet and reserved lady who tries her
        best at anything she does. She is eager to know more people to conquer her shyness but her tragic
        childhood prevents her from doing so, especially around grown men. Once the abuse of her father
        ended, she was placed at an orphanage where she met her first true friend Jenine Zantaella. Despite
        Jenine's best efforts, Aeni was abused again by the adults of the orphanage. Jenine devised a plan
        to leave and go to America. They succeeded in landing but were separated. Soon, Aeni made it to Los
        Angeles where she was found by Eliza's father and was adopted into the Azarius household. There, she
        began her new life as Eliza's sister and best friend, even following her to Las Vegas. Her goal
        is to become a gymnast and teach everyone the wonders of gymnastics.

        energy of Yggrasil, the only magic of its kind to rival even the Eternals in energy. Her capabilities
        are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Divine Ice <em>(Cryo-kinesis)</em></li>
        <li>Regeneration</li>
        <li>Magic Manipulation</li>

        proficient with her power.
