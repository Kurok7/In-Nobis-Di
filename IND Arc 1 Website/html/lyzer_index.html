    <h4 id="yourself">About</h4>
    <p>Eliza Azarius (O.G. name of Lyzer Spinel) is a book smart woman that is not afraid to go after what she wants.
        She keeps to herself most of the time and it's hard for her to establish an emotional connection with people 
        (aside from her sister Fliz). She's pragmatic on a lot of issues, concerned about her own self interests and
        socially awkward. She enjoys reading and writing. She's detached from the world and its affairs unless it benefits
        her in some way. Her main goal is to figure out what happened to her father. Her dream is to open a non-profit
        for orphaned kids to help cope with their trauma. Over the course of the story, she learns the meaning of 
        being a leader, opening up to strangers and a sense of duty.

        amount of Heraldic potential. She is capable of many feats with her powers, including the added benefit
